*Note:
Sometimes, you promote or demote an admin manually, and Emma doesn't realise it immediately. This is because to avoid spamming telegram servers, admin status is cached locally.
This means that you sometimes have to wait a few minutes for admin rights to update. If you want to update them immediately, you can use the /admincache command; that'll force Emma to check who the admins are again.
